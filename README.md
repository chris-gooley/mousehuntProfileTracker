# Mousehunter Tracker

### Looking for maintainers!

I no longer play the game and am looking for someone to take over hosting. If you are interested flick me a message.

This little app is designed to track users progress in the Hitgrab game [Mousehunt](https://mousehuntgame.com).

It tracks your gold and points progress, as well as mice breeds caught and a few other things. Once you signup, the app will start scanning your publicly accessible profile every 2 hours and graph the result (it'll take a bit of time before the graphs start looking pretty though).

### App Info
- Ruby on Rails 5.0.0
- Ruby 2.4.1
